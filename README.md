# SimpleSupport
ASP.NET MVC based Michigan Child Support Calculator based on the Michigan Child Support Formula

The current version of SimpleSupport can be found running at http://ZapLeaf.com.

This project was created to learn ASP.NET MVC, Bootstrap, Entity Framework, jQuery, and LINQ.

We are currently refactoring the code as way to learn various patterns and best practices. These include things like Repository Pattern and some of the SOLID principles.

Thank You,<br />
